# Multiwavelet toolbox

# Abstract

The Wavelet transform in the last decades gained a lot of popularity among researchers for its properties and abilities. The main subject of this article is the Multiwavelet transform, which derivates from the Wavelet transform and has the same properties and abilities while providing additional properties and abilities, which the Wavelet transform cannot achieve. There exists a lot of freely available and easy-to-use tools to implement Wavelet transform. This cannot be said about the Multiwavelet transform. Based on that fact, the Multiwavelet toolbox for Matlab is proposed in the article. The article consists of two main parts. The first one is focused on Multiwavelet transform description and particularly on its convolution implementation.  The second part describes the proposed toolbox and shows some examples of its uses. The proposed toolbox consists of more than 25 original functions and scripts, and it is offered as GPL licensed software for scientific and learning purposes.

We will be happy about any suggestions, ideas and contributions to improve this toolbox. It is also possible to add custom Multiwavelet as long you know matrix impulse responses of the Multiwavelet.

This toolbox is licensed under the GPLv3 for scientific and learning purposes in hope it will be usefull for anyone who wants to learn about Multiwavelets and Multiwavelet transform or to make research about them.  
If this software is used to make a contribution to the findings
published in an article, then please consider citing our conference
paper, from which this toolbox originates.
