function [c11, c12, d11, d12] = DMWT(in, multiwavelet, varargin)
% DMWT implements the discrete multiwavelet transform using the
% four-channel single filter bank.
% Input variables:
% in: input signal (must be dividable by 8)
% multiwavelet: multiwavelet used for implementing DMWT (as string)
% varargin: It is possible to define custom extension according to MATLAB
% extensions. If not defined then periodic extension will be used
% Output variables:
% c11, c12, d11, d12: multiscaling and multiwavelet coefficients
% Examples:
% [c11, c12, d11, d12] = DMWT(signal, 'DGHM');
% [c11, c12, d11, d12] = DMWT(signal, 'DB2', 'sym');

% Load Multiwavelet from string representation
multiwavelet = loadMW(multiwavelet);

% Handling the extension. If wasnt defined choose periodic, otherwise try
% to load defined extension. If defined extension doesnt exist throw and
% exception
if isempty(varargin)
    extension = 'per';
else
    extension = varargin{1};
    try
        wextend('ac', extension, [1 2 1], 2);
    catch 
        ME = MException('IDMWT:wrongExtension', ...
            'Extension name doesnt exist!');
        throw(ME);
    end
end

% Checking if the input singal is dividable by 8
if ((mod(size(in, 2),8) ~= 0))
    ME = MException('IDMWT:wrongDataLength', ...
        'Input signal should be dividable by 8');
    throw(ME);
end
