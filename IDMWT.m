function out = IDMWT(c11, c12, d11, d12, multiwavelet, varargin)
% IDMWT implements the inverse discrete multiwavelet transform using the
% four-channel single filter bank.
% Input variables:
% c11, c12, d11, d12: multiscaling and multiwavelet coefficients
% multiwavelet: multiwavelet used for implementing DMWT (as string)
% varargin: It is possible to define custom extension according to MATLAB
% extensions. If not defined then periodic extension will be used
% Output variables:
% out: output reconstructed signal
% Examples:
% output = IDMWT(c11, c12, d11, d12, 'CL02');
% output = IDMWT(c11, c12, d11, d12, 'BAT01', 'zpd');

% Load Multiwavelet from string representation
multiwavelet = loadMW(multiwavelet);

% Handling the extension. If wasnt defined choose periodic, otherwise try
% to load defined extension. If defined extension doesnt exist throw and
% exception
if isempty(varargin)
    extension = 'per';
else
    extension = varargin{1};
    try
        wextend('ac', extension, [1 2 1], 2);
    catch 
        ME = MException('IDMWT:wrongExtension',...
            'Extension name doesnt exist!');
        throw(ME);
    end
end

% applying the extension on input coeficients

c11 = wextend('ac', extension, c11, ad);
c12 = wextend('ac', extension, c12, ad);
d11 = wextend('ac', extension, d11, ad);
d12 = wextend('ac', extension, d12, ad);

% Interpolating input coeficient by interpolation factor 4
c11 = upsample(c11', 4)';
c12 = upsample(c12', 4)';
d11 = upsample(d11', 4)';

% Calculating length of output signal after convolution and creating
% variables with calculated length

% four-channel single filter bank
for j = 1:size(c11, 1)
